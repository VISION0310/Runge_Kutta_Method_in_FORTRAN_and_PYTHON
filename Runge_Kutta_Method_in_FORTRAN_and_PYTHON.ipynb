        "Runge–Kutta (R–K) methods are the most widely used numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It is especially suitable in the case of ordinary differential equations, where the computation of higher derivatives is complicated. In compared to simpler Euler’s explicit method, R–K methods provide more accurate solution. Here we will discussing two method use to find approximate solution of ordinary differential equation in numerical analysis with initial conditions are given.\n",
